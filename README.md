Elven Token Forge is a user-friendly platform designed to empower anyone to effortlessly create and manage custom ESDT (Elven Standard Digital Token) tokens on the MultiversX network. Our wizard-driven interface guides you through every step, from token issuance to providing initial liquidity on xExchange, all without needing to write a single line of code.

**Note:** This project is currently in its early frontend development stages. Core blockchain interactions and wallet connections are mocked for UI/UX development and testing purposes.

## üéØ About The Project

The MultiversX blockchain offers powerful capabilities for tokenization, but the process can be daunting for those without deep technical expertise. Elven Token Forge aims to bridge this gap by providing an intuitive, secure, and comprehensive toolkit for:

-   **Effortless Token Creation:** Design your token's properties (name, ticker, supply, decimals, special capabilities) through a simple wizard.
-   **Seamless Liquidity Provision:** Create a trading pair for your token and provide initial liquidity on the MultiversX xExchange.
-   **Intuitive Token Management:** (Future) Manage token supply, roles, and permissions from a central dashboard.

Our philosophy is "Non-Custodial & User-Controlled." All blockchain interactions are designed to be signed directly by you in your connected wallet, ensuring you always maintain full control over your assets.

**(Current Focus: Frontend and UX for wizards and dashboard layout, with dummy data and mocked wallet interactions.)**

## ‚ú® Key Features (Current & Planned)

-   üßô **Wizard-Driven Token Issuance:**
    -   Define token name, ticker, initial supply, and decimals.
    -   Configure advanced ESDT properties (e.g., `canFreeze`, `canWipe`, `canMint`, `canBurn`, `canChangeOwner`, `canUpgrade`).
    -   Clear review of details and estimated network fees before submission.
-   üíß **Wizard-Driven Liquidity Provision:**
    -   Select your token and a pairing token (e.g., EGLD, USDC).
    -   Set initial amounts and preview the starting price.
    -   Understand risks associated with liquidity provision.
    -   (Mocked) Deposit tokens and create the liquidity pool on xExchange.
-   üõ°Ô∏è **Secure Wallet Integration (Mocked):**
    -   Connect via (simulated) MultiversX Browser Extension, Web Wallet, xPortal App, or Ledger.
    -   Dummy address display and connect/disconnect functionality.
-   üñ•Ô∏è **Token Dashboard (Layout & Mock Data):**
    -   Overview of your created/managed tokens.
    -   Detailed view for selected tokens (information, properties, balance).
    -   (Planned) Actions for token management (mint, burn, role management).
    -   (Planned) Analytics and recent activity.
-   üîê **Protected Routes:** Ensures certain pages (like token creation/liquidity wizards, dashboard) require a (mocked) "connected" wallet state.
-   üé® **Modern & Responsive UI:** Built with Tailwind CSS and Shadcn/ui for a clean, accessible, and adaptive experience across devices.
-   üçÉ **Neo-Material Design:** A unique visual style blending modern aesthetics with subtle neo-material elements for a premium feel.
